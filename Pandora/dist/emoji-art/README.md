# Emoji Art Maker - Automatic Emoji Mosaics

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/RwomyVL](https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/RwomyVL).

Using over three thousand emojis  analyzed on-the-fly and used as pixels,  this fun and useful utility can make ultra-high (or ultra-low) resolution emoji mosaics from any image!

You can control the resolution  and customize the look of the final result by tweaking the settings. 

A desktop computer is recommended for the best experience.

If you are dead serious about emoji mosaics, check out the "version 2" of this application, features double and treble sized emojis, videos, effects, and more:
